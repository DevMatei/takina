# Takina
A simple multipurpose bot for Discord.
For a list of features and other information please visit: https://orangc.xyz/takina.

## installation
Using the Dockerfile or Nix. You must set the env variables in a `.env` file; check `.env.example` to see which ones to set. You must have a mongodb instance running to run most cogs in Takina.

## TODO
- (long term) document all code with comments
- fix incorrect uptime display
- make neko commands applicable to users
- upgrade snipe command: snipe specific user perhaps
- upgrade purge command: purge only the bot, purge specific user, purge all bots, purge before/after specific date
- dont allow two triggers with the same trigger; and potentially fix the thing where triggers are faster than commands
