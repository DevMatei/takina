# Takina
A utility bot for weebs. Takina is under heavy development; so far, I have the following features ready:

- anime searching — `?anime Lycoris Recoil`
- manga searching — `?manga Shikanoko`
- character searching — `?chr Takina Inoue`
- user profiles — `?mal orangc`
- seasonal anime — `?season Summer 2022`

All of which are displayed in neat little embeds. More information/documentation may be available later at orangc.xyz/takina.
Takina utilizes the Jikan API for all of these things.
Takina also has a few other things, such as utility commands and a moderation system.

## installation
Using the Dockerfile or Nix.
